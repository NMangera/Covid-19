# Covid-19

An infectious disease caused by a type of coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2. This repository contains code focused around research and awareness of the virus. The dataset is principally the contribution of Our World in Data, whose mission it is to make data and research on the worldâ€™s largest problems understandable and accessible.

**Confirmed cases and deaths:** The data comes from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The cases & deaths dataset is updated daily. 

**Note:** the number of cases or deaths reported by any institution on a given day does not necessarily represent the actual number on that date. This is because of the reporting chain that exists between a new case/death and its inclusion in statistics. Alternatively, large changes can sometimes (although rarely) be made to a country's entire time series if the ECDC decides (and has access to the necessary data) to correct values retrospectively.

**Testing for COVID-19:** The data is collected from official in-country reports. The testing data is updated twice a week.

A breakdown of each variable can be found in the csv labelled 'codebook', along with the source for each variable in the dataset.
